# DAY 7 after the Farewell

* I know, "doesnt goes" isn't correct but I'm too exhausted for beautiful correct words.

I feel suffocated as if I was closed in a coffin deep inside the ground.
Maybe it's because I supress emotions in order to be able to keep breathing.
I wouldn't say that I've done a lot of things during these 7 days but I see the results.

# Some deeds

1. I know that I need to love myself so I wrote the list of needs which I usually expect to get from a romantic partner. I will post it in the next repo and do them on my own for myself not waiting for someone else.
2. I restarted to go gym and volunteering.
3. I texted my older brother whom I'm usually afraid of to speak.
4. I started to say my thoughts to people around, even if they may be offensive. Being extremely straight and sincere really helps.
5. I planned the hardest tasks for next several weeks.
6. When these was a choice about me and a patient I chose myself. My previous sacrifices didn't end well so I won't sacrifice myself anymore.
7. I decided that I won't suicide even if I still think about it.
8. I've chosen more direct and heartless way to deal with sadness - supressing and criticism. Although the last one is my old best friend.

I will be more clear in next repo, now I'm feelinf too sleepy to type.
See you soon, future me.
